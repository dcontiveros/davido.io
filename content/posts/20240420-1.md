Besides the obvious 4/20 holiday, I decided to start posting more on here to
showcase more projects and thoughts.

We have a new 2k -> 40k Poker Challenge. The links will updated on this page after we get some traction going. Hoping we get this one completed.

We are also streaming our attemps to go through Neetcode 150 to see how we stack
against others. Intro page will be forthcoming.

And finally, I graduated college. Decent accomplishment I suppose. Another person completes the 15 year plan!
