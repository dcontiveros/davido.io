This is my revamped blog. My aim is low bandwidth requirements with dark mode always on. 

My last blog was severely outdated. The phasing out of FreeBSD droplets on DigitalOcean was the nail in the coffin for me. I decided to jump ship to a provider who is located in a privacy centric country and who supports custom ISOs on Qemu/KVM VPS instances.

I am extremely happy with this host, as this blog is static and only needs a decent uplink. Cryptocurrency transactions are also a nice payment method since I do not trust credit card numbers at all. 

More programming soon to come.
