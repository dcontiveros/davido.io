### Status

### Problem

Here is the link to the Leetcode problem:

[Leetcode 42](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)

First LC hard problem.

### Root Cause Analysis

I failed this module entirely. Not only did I not get a SINGLE test case, I didn't even identify the correct use of the `max()` function. I was so hung up on attempting to find the correct algorithm in the allotted time I didn't even think about utilizing this function.

There are *SOME* positives from this module, however. I didn't code anything until I knew the algorithm was correct. I have been complaining  that I do not do this enough, and when I took the time to try and map the pointers in Excel, I appreciated the fact I told myself that code is worthless without the working algo.

The entire video is me trying to figure out the algo. Hopefully someone can use that to their advantage.

### Summary

Failed everything. Wow.

### Action items

1. Get more familiar with min/max problems.

### Final thoughts

This was my first Leetcode hard. I failed it but I don't think it was an entire failure. Talking out the algorithm and seeing where it failed was quite satisfying. Code less and think more should be my approach from here on out.

It sucks I didn't solve this in the required timeframe. I cannot imagine this on a job interview.
