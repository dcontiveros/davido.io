### Intro

This is my retrospective analysis after completing the Two Pointers section on the Neetcode150 list.

### Record

Here is the table of all attempts:

| #  | Time   | Test Cases |
|----|--------|------------|
| 10 | ❌ | ✅ |
| 11 | ❌ | ✅ |
| 12 | ❌ | ✅ |
| 13 | ❌ | ✅ |
| 14 | ❌ | ❌ |

We achieved `40%` for this round. Terrible.

### Thoughts

Test cases appear to be getting easier. I also noticed I'm hitting more optimal solutions. Let's say I cheated, which one stream I did, and replaced my optimal. We managed to only change a few lines.

The streams are there for receipts. Accountability is key.

Going over the mechanics of the algos seems to be benefiting me. I am spending less time on fumbling by setting up the code, but I was not able to solve any of the problems within time constraints. From now on, I will give myself 40 minutes for one problem.

I encountered my first leetcode hard. We spent the entire stream trying to figure out the problem. I need to start thinking outside of just implementing an algo, and into recognizing HOW to use the algo to solve the problem.

I also need to do this more often. I feel it is more difficult to keep restarting rather than being consistent. Only one way to get the prize.

I've also decided to do a System Designs deep dive. Stay tuned!
